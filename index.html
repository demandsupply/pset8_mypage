            <p>Photography is a medium that has captured the imagination of people for over a century, and it continues to do so today.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>At its core, photography is an <b>art form</b> that captures the <b>beauty</b>, <b>emotion</b>, and <b>essence of the world</b> around us.</p>
            <p>However, photography is not just a technical skill or a way of documenting reality; it is a <b>deeply philosophical pursuit </b>that raises fundamental questions about perception and subjectivity.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Photography as a Cultural and Emotional Response</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <figcaption>Some text</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Let’s take a deeper dive into this topic by looking at what French philosopher <b>Roland Barthes</b> has said. He argued that photography is not simply a representation of reality, but a <b>cultural construct</b> shaped by various factors.</p>
                <p>In his book <b>“Camera Lucida”</b>, Barthes argues that a photograph has two elements. First, the cultural, historical, and social context of the image. Secondly, the personal, emotional, and subjective response to the image.</p>
                <p>When we take a photo, we are not simply taking a picture of what is there; we are also interpreting and creating an image based on our <b>personal experiences.</b></p>

                <h3>Photography as a Form of Creation</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <figcaption>Some text</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>It can be said that photography is not just a form of interpretation, but a form of creation as well. American photographer and critic <b>Minor White</b> once argued, 
                        “One should not only photograph things for what they are but for what else they are.”</p>
                <p>This quote speaks to the idea that photography is not solely about capturing what is visible, but what is <b>invisible</b>, such as <b>emotions</b>, <b>ideas</b>, and <b>concepts</b>.</p>
                <p>Photographer <b>Yan </b>agrees:</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    <span style="font-size: 64px;">"</span>
                    <p class="quote-text">Our memories form such an intrinsic part of our self. This is why when we look at the past, at old photos, we get hit with nostalgia. It could reveal the emotions you carry like 
                        holding your newborn as a parent, the excitement and joy. A photo tells so many things and reads off differently for every person. Photography is so powerful because that is proof of our 
                        physical and intangible existence at that point in time.” </p>
                </div>
                <figure>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <figcaption>Some text</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <div class="quote">
                    <span style="font-size: 64px;">"</span>
                    <p>Although the camera usually limits the photographer to capturing existing objects, I believe a skilled person can still be creative within the mechanical reproduction process. 
                        For example, you can frame an image in a unique way, such as capturing a reflection of a subject or using shadows to create an interesting composition. 
                        This can convey a certain concept, like the feeling of loneliness.” </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>So, What is Photography?</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                        <figcaption>Some text</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Photography is a <b>deeply meaningful pursuit</b> because it challenges our worldview.</p>
                    <p>It raises questions about the <b>nature of reality </b>and how it is represented through images. Is reality objective, or is it subjective?</p>
                    <p>These are some of the fundamental questions that photography raises, and it is this aspect that makes it such a fascinating art form!</p>
